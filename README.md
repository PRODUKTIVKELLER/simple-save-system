## Advanced Features

### Shipped Save Slot

For testing purposes it can be helpful to ship a save game on a certain save slot. 
If you want to do so, create a `ShippedSaveSlot` by right-clicking in the Project 
view and select `Create > PRODUKTIVKELLER > Simple Save System > Shipped Save Slot`. 
Put the file in a *Resource* folder, so it will be found when the game starts. 
Put the JSON data in the scriptable object and specify the save slot you want to use.
